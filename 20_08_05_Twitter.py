This problem was asked by Twitter.

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.
You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

class Log(object):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self._log = []
        self._cur = 0

    def record(self, order_id):
        if len(self._log) == self.n:
            self._log[self._cur] = order_id
        else:
            self._log.append(order_id)
        self._cur = (self._cur + 1) % self.n

    def get_last(self, i):
        return self._log[self._cur - i]
